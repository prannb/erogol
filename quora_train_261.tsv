It works smoothly on other WiFi networks and my home WiFi works well on the devices of other members of my family. What should I do?	Wifi problem... My Mtnl wifi router is frustrating me from the last one week. I use it to connect my galaxy ace plus to the internet. The porblem is that router is responding slowly while i surf the internet though i'm getting full speed of 2mbps. I also use my phone's wifi in my college and there the phone works fine and responds quickly. I tried to connect some other phone to connect with my router and the router is giving quick reply to that phone. I'm unable to find where the problem is. I tried to contact mtnl for the same but they are not entertaining me. Please help me out...	0
